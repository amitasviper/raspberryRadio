Thanks for downloading PiStation1.1!

This is an open source program.





Section 1

To use this you will need the correct format of music.  The correct format is written below.

					16 bit mono wav
					      or
					16 bit stereo 25050 wav/mp3

You can use this software to convert your music. (http://www.dbpoweramp.com/dmc.htm)




Section 2

I recomend that you put your music in the same folder that the RUN.py and the PiStation1.0.py program are in for simplicity.

Make sure the pifm file is also in the same folder





Section 3

Start the program by uploading it to your PI and running the command, "python RUN.py"

You can run the DarthVader.wav file as a test run.
